# Nuklear Node Editor

This is a heavily extended version of Nuklear's node editor available in the demo directory.

###### Features
- Multiple instances - no global state.
- Unlinking.
- Link snapping.
- Switching link places on the same node.
- Nodes with infinite amount of input slots (up to a settable hard limit).
- Node deleting.
- Custom draw functions per node.

There is also a number of things fixed in the node editor (like grid moving the opposite side when moving the window around), as well as other changes that I forgot to mention.
